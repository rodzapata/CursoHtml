      Word stress is your magic key to understanding spoken English. <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/Native.html"
        target="_blank">Native</a> speakers of English
      use word stress <span class="stress">na</span>turally. Word stress is so natural for them that they don't <a
        class="adverb" href="vocabulary/even.html" target="_blank">even</a> know
      they use it. Non-native speakers <a class="pronoun" href="vocabulary/who.html" target="_blank">who</a> speak

    <p>
      1. They find it difficult to understand native speakers, especially those speaking fast. <br>
      2. The native speakers may find it difficult to understand them. <br>

  <h2 id="word_stress-what">What is Word Strees ?</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      In English, we do not say each syllable with the same force or <a class="noun"
        href="vocabulary/strength.html">strength</a>.
      In one word, we a<span class="stress">ccen</span>tuate ONE syllable.
      We say one syllable very <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/loudly.html" target="_blank">loudly</a> (big, strong,
      important)
      and all the other syllables very <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/quietly.html" target="_blank">quietly</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take 3 words: photograph, photographer and photographic. Do they sound the same when spoken? No.
      Be<span class="stress">cause</span> we accentuate (stress) ONE syllable in each word. And it is not always the
      same syllable.
      So the "shape" of each word is different. PHO-to-graph, pho-TO-graph-er, pho-to-GRAPH-ic
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to these words. Do you hear the stressed syllable in each word?
    </p>
    <p>
      This happens in ALL words with 2 or more syllables: TEACHer, JaPAN, CHINa, aBOVE, converSAtion,
      INteresting, imPORtant, deMAND, etCETera, etCETera, etCETera.
    </p>
    <p>
      The syllables that are not stressed are <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/weak.html" target="_blank">weak</a>
      or small or quiet.
      Fluent speakers of English listen for the STRESSED syllables,
      not the weak syllables. If you use word stress in your <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/speech.html"
        target="_blank">speech</a> ,
      you will <span class="stress">ins</span>tantly and auto<span class="stress">ma</span>tically im<span
        class="stress">prove</span> your
      pronunciation and your compre<span class="stress">hen</span>sion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try to hear the stress in indi<span class="stress">vi</span>dual words each time you listen to English - on the
      radio,
      or in films for example. Your first <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/step.html" target="_blank">step</a>
      is to HEAR and recognise it. After that, you can USE it!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two very important rules about word stress: <br>
      1. One word, one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses. So if you hear two stresses, you have heard two
      words, not one word.)
      2. The stress is always on a vowel.

  <h2 id="word_stress-why">Why is Word Strees important?</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Word stress is not used in all languages. Some languages, Japanese or French for example, pronounce each syllable
      with eq-ual em-pha-sis.
      Other languages, English for example, use word stress and pro-NOUNCE DIF-fer-ent SYL-la-bles with more or less
      im-POR-tance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Word stress is not an optional extra that you can add to the English language if you want.
      It is part of the language! Fluent English speakers use word stress to communicate rapidly and
      <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/accurately.html" target="_blank">accurately</a>, even in difficult conditions.
      If, for example, you do not hear a word clearly, you can still understand the word because of the position of the
      stress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/again.html" target="_blank">again</a> about the two words photograph and
      photographer.
      Now imagine that you are speaking to <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/somebody.html"
        target="_blank">somebody</a> by telephone
      <a class="preposition" href="vocabulary/over.html" target="_blank">over</a> a very bad line. You cannot hear
      clearly.
      In fact, you hear only the first two syllables of one of these words, photo... Which word is it, photograph or
      photographer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, with word stress you will know immediately which word it is because in reality you will hear either..

  <article>
    <p>
      There are some word stress rules about which syllable to stress.
      But...the rules are rather complicated! Probably the best way to learn is from experience.
      Listen carefully to spoken English and try to develop a feeling for the "music" of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you learn a new word, you should also learn its stress pattern.
      If you keep a vocabulary book, make a note to show which syllable is stressed.
      If you do not know, you can look in a dictionary.
      All dictionaries give the phonetic spelling of a word. This is where they show which syllable is stressed,
      usually with an apostrophe (') just before or just after the stressed syllable.
      (The notes in the dictionary will explain the system used.)

  <h2 id="word_stress-rules">Word Strees Rules</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      There are two very simple rules about word stress: <br>
      1. One word has only one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses.
      If you hear two stresses, you hear two words. Two stresses cannot be one word.
      It is true that there can be a "secondary" stress in some words.
      But a secondary stress is much smaller than the main [primary] stress, and is only used in long words.) <br><br>
      2. We can only stress vowels, not consonants.
      Here are some more, rather complicated, rules that can help you understand where to put the stress.
      But do not rely on them too much, because there are many exceptions.
      It is better to try to "feel" the music of the language and to add the stress naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many two-syllable words in English <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/whose.html"
        target="_blank">whose</a>
      <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/meaning.html" target="_blank">meaning</a> and class change with a change in
      stress.
      The word <b>present</b> , for example is a two-syllable word. If we stress the first syllable,
      it is a noun (<a class="noun" href="vocabulary/gift.html" target="_blank">gift</a>) or an adjective (opposite of
      absent).
      But if we stress the second syllable, it <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/becomes.html"
        target="_blank">becomes</a> a verb (to offer).
      More examples: the words export, import,
      contract and object can all be nouns or verbs depending on <a class="conj" href="vocabulary/whether.html"
        target="_blank">whether</a> the
      stress is on the first or second syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compound words (words with two parts) : <br><br>
      For compound nouns, the stress is on the first part, examples: BLACKbird, GREENhouse. <br>
      For compound adjectives, the stress is on the second part, example: bad-TEMpered, old-FASHioned. <br>
      For compound verbs, the stress is on the second part, example: underSTAND, overFLOW. <br>

  <article>
    <p>
      Sentence stress is the music of spoken English. Like word stress,
      sentence stress can help you to understand spoken English, even rapid spoken English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentence stress is what <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/gives.html" target="_blank">gives</a> English its rhythm
      or "beat". <br>
      You remember that word stress is accent on one syllable <a class="preposition" href="vocabulary/within.html"
        target="_blank">within</a> a word.
      Sentence stress is accent on certain words within a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most sentences have two basic types of word: <br>
      1. content words: <br>
      Content words are the key words of a sentence. They are the important words that
      <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/carry.html" target="_blank">carry</a> the meaning or sense—the real content. <br>
      2. structure words: <br>
      Structure words are not very important words. They are small,
      simple words that make the sentence correct grammatically.
      They give the sentence its correct form—its structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you remove the structure words from a sentence, you will probably still understand the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you remove the content words from a sentence, you will not understand the sentence. The sentence has no sense
      or meaning.
    </p>
  </article>

  <h2 id="Sentence-stress-rules">Sentence stress Rules</h2>
  <article>
    The basic rules of sentence stress are:
    <ul>
      <li>content words are stressed</li>
      <li>structure words are unstressed</li>
      <li>the time between stressed words is always the same</li>

      Because of this linking, the words in a sentence do not always sound the same as when we say them individually.
      Linking is very important in English. If you recognize and use linking, two things will happen:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. you will understand other people more easily
      2. other people will understand you more easily
    </p>
    <p>
      There are basically two main types of linking: <br>

      consonant ⇔ vowel <br>
      We link words ending with a consonant sound to words beginning with a vowel sound <br>
      vowel ⇔ vowel <br>
      We link words ending with a vowel sound to words beginning with a vowel sound <br>

    <p>
      Hi guys, this is the clear English <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/corner.html" target="_blank">corner</a>,
      and I'm Keenan, your personal American English pronunci<span class="stress">a</span>tion <a class="noun"
        href="vocabulary/coach.html" target="_blank">coach</a>. <br>
      In this lesson we're talking about something you really, have to do,
      if you truly want to sound, more natural and native, in your <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/spoken.html"
        target="_blank">spoken</a> English.
    </p>
    <P>
      You have to use contractions. I know, it sounds
      <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/counterintuitive.html" target="_blank">counterin<span
          class="stress">tu</span>itive</a>,
      but using contractions is super important to achieving the natural rhythm and flow, you're looking for,
      in your spoken English. <br>
      you're probably thinking, Keenan if I <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/take.html" target="_blank">take</a> sounds
      out of words and deliberately shorten them isn't
      that gonna make me harder to understand ?,
      and truly the <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/answer.html" target="_blank">answer</a> is no, if your audience is
      primarily native English speakers.
    </P>
    <p>
      Native speakers use contractions, all the time, and when you don't use contractions,
      it's an immediate tell that English, is not your first language,
      I am excited, and she is the best, don't flow as well as,
      so there's a <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/lot.html" target="_blank">lot</a> of contractions in English,
      and it gets <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/overwhelming.html" target="_blank">overwhelming</a> to try to
      learn all these contractions,
      and reductions, so let's <a class="verb_phrasal" href="vocabulary/narrow_it_down.html" target="_blank">narrow it
        down</a>, to the contractions that are most common,
      over the next few lessons, we're going to practice the most <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/common.html"
        target="_blank">common</a> contractions,
      together, and these are the ones, I would focus on first,
      these are the ones that occur most <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/often.html" target="_blank">often</a>,
      and in this lesson we're going to start with ,
      the most common contractions, the present form of the verb to be or is R and M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alright so <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/diving.html" target="_blank">diving</a> in with is,
      because seriously, if you're going to contract,
      <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/any.html" target="_blank">any</a> word in your spoken English,
      this <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/should.html" target="_blank">should</a> be the one,
      <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/pretty.html" target="_blank">pretty</a> much anytime,
      this word is coming in the <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/middle.html" target="_blank">middle</a> of a sentence,
      you're going to use it in contracted form,
      <a class="conj" href="vocabulary/unless.html" target="_blank">unless</a> you're trying to emphasize something,
      a <a class="conj" href="vocabulary/lot.html" target="_blank">lot</a> of times agreeing, or confirming something,
      this is an incredible view, I think he is a little <a class="adjective" href="vocabulary/worried.html"
        target="_blank">worried</a> about it,
      so let's practice contracting is with pronouns, all right, so he is, becomes he's.
    </p>
    <p>
      she is, becomes, she's, and it is, becomes it's,
      you'll notice there's two different sounds, to this apostrophe s,
      after the vowel sound E, and he, and she, because,
      it's voiced vowels are always voiced the S sounds,
      like he's she's, after the T and it's which is, a voiceless sound,
      the apostrophe s sounds, like it's it's, in general this distinction happens,
      when the contracted, is comes after a, or it sounds like,
      and when it comes after a voiced sound, it sounds like now I know some of you are out
      there saying but Kenan it doesn't always sound like this is after a voiced consonant.

      The title says it’s the hard way to learn to write code, but it’s actually not. 
      It’s only the ”hard” way because it uses a technique called instruction. 
      Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. 
      This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before 
      they can understand more complex topics. It’s used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills.
