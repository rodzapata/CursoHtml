            Word stress is your magic key to understanding spoken English. <a class="adjetive" href="vocabulary/Native.html" target="_blank">Native</a> speakers of English
            use word stress <span class="stress">na</span>turally. Word stress is so natural for them that they don't <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/even.html" target="_blank">even</a> know 
            they use it. Non-native speakers <a class="pronoun" href="vocabulary/who.html" target="_blank">who</a> speak English to native speakers
            <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/without.html" target="_blank">without</a>  using word stress, 
            encounter two problems: 
          </p>
          <p>  
            1. They find it difficult to understand native speakers, especially those speaking fast. <br>
            2. The native speakers may find it difficult to understand them. <br>
            In this lesson we look at the most important aspects of word stress,

            In English, we do not say each syllable with the same force or <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/strength.html">strength</a>. 
            In one word, we a<span class="stress">ccen</span>tuate ONE syllable.
            We say one syllable very <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/loudly.html" target="_blank">loudly</a> (big, strong, important) 
            and all the other syllables very <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/quietly.html" target="_blank">quietly</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take 3 words: photograph, photographer and photographic. Do they sound the same when spoken? No. 
            Be<span class="stress">cause</span> we accentuate (stress) ONE syllable in each word. And it is not always the same syllable. 
            So the "shape" of each word is different. PHO-to-graph, pho-TO-graph-er, pho-to-GRAPH-ic 
          </p>
          <p>
            Listen to these words. Do you hear the stressed syllable in each word?
          </p>
          <p>
            This happens in ALL words with 2 or more syllables: TEACHer, JaPAN, CHINa, aBOVE, converSAtion,
            INteresting, imPORtant, deMAND, etCETera, etCETera, etCETera.
          </p>
          <p>
            The syllables that are not stressed are <a class="adjetive" href="vocabulary/weak.html" target="_blank">weak</a> or small or quiet. 
            Fluent speakers of English listen for the STRESSED syllables, 
            not the weak syllables. If you use word stress in your <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/speech.html" target="_blank">speech</a> , 
            you will <span class="stress">ins</span>tantly and auto<span class="stress">ma</span>tically im<span class="stress">prove</span> your 
            pronunciation and your compre<span class="stress">hen</span>sion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to hear the stress in indi<span class="stress">vi</span>dual words each time you listen to English - on the radio, 
            or in films for example. Your first <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/step.html" target="_blank">step</a>  
            is to HEAR and recognise it. After that, you can USE it!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two very important rules about word stress: <br>
            1. One word, one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses. So if you hear two stresses, you have heard two words, not one word.)
            2. The stress is always on a vowel.

        <article>
          <p>
            Word stress is not used in all languages. Some languages, Japanese or French for example, pronounce each syllable with eq-ual em-pha-sis.
            Other languages, English for example, use word stress and pro-NOUNCE DIF-fer-ent SYL-la-bles with more or less im-POR-tance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Word stress is not an optional extra that you can add to the English language if you want. 
            It is part of the language! Fluent English speakers use word stress to communicate rapidly and 
            <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/accurately.html" target="_blank">accurately</a>, even in difficult conditions. 
            If, for example, you do not hear a word clearly, you can still understand the word because of the position of the stress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/again.html" target="_blank">again</a> about the two words photograph and photographer. 
            Now imagine that you are speaking to <a class="adverb" href="vocabulary/somebody.html" target="_blank">somebody</a> by telephone 
            <a class="preposition" href="vocabulary/over.html" target="_blank">over</a> a very bad line. You cannot hear clearly. 
            In fact, you hear only the first two syllables of one of these words, photo... Which word is it, photograph or photographer?
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, with word stress you will know immediately which word it is because in reality you will hear either..

        <article>
          <p>
            There are some word stress rules about which syllable to stress. 
            But...the rules are rather complicated! Probably the best way to learn is from experience. 
            Listen carefully to spoken English and try to develop a feeling for the "music" of the language.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you learn a new word, you should also learn its stress pattern. 
            If you keep a vocabulary book, make a note to show which syllable is stressed. 
            If you do not know, you can look in a dictionary. 
            All dictionaries give the phonetic spelling of a word. This is where they show which syllable is stressed, 
            usually with an apostrophe (') just before or just after the stressed syllable. 
            (The notes in the dictionary will explain the system used.)

        <h2 id="word_stress-rules">Word Strees Rules</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            There are two very simple rules about word stress: <br>
            1. One word has only one stress. (One word cannot have two stresses. 
            If you hear two stresses, you hear two words. Two stresses cannot be one word. 
            It is true that there can be a "secondary" stress in some words. 
            But a secondary stress is much smaller than the main [primary] stress, and is only used in long words.) <br><br>  
            2. We can only stress vowels, not consonants.
            Here are some more, rather complicated, rules that can help you understand where to put the stress. 
            But do not rely on them too much, because there are many exceptions. 
            It is better to try to "feel" the music of the language and to add the stress naturally.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many two-syllable words in English <a class="adjetive" href="vocabulary/whose.html" target="_blank">whose</a>  
            <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/meaning.html" target="_blank">meaning</a> and class change with a change in stress. 
            The word <b>present</b> , for example is a two-syllable word. If we stress the first syllable, 
            it is a noun (<a class="noun" href="vocabulary/gift.html" target="_blank">gift</a>) or an adjective (opposite of absent). 
            But if we stress the second syllable, it <a class="noun" href="vocabulary/becomes.html" target="_blank">becomes</a> a verb (to offer). 
            More examples: the words export, import, 
            contract and object can all be nouns or verbs depending on <a class="conj" href="vocabulary/whether.html" target="_blank">whether</a> the 
            stress is on the first or second syllable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compound words (words with two parts) : <br><br>
            For compound nouns, the stress is on the first part, examples: BLACKbird, GREENhouse. <br>
            For compound adjectives, the stress is on the second part, example: bad-TEMpered, old-FASHioned. <br>
            For compound verbs, the stress is on the second part, example: underSTAND, overFLOW. <br>

          <p>
            Sentence stress is the music of spoken English. Like word stress, 
            sentence stress can help you to understand spoken English, even rapid spoken English.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sentence stress is what <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/gives.html" target="_blank">gives</a> English its rhythm or "beat". <br>
            You remember that word stress is accent on one syllable <a class="preposition" href="vocabulary/within.html" target="_blank">within</a> a word. 
            Sentence stress is accent on certain words within a sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most sentences have two basic types of word: <br>
            1. content words: <br>
            Content words are the key words of a sentence. They are the important words that 
            <a class="verb" href="vocabulary/carry.html" target="_blank">carry</a> the meaning or sense—the real content. <br>
            2. structure words: <br>
            Structure words are not very important words. They are small, 
            simple words that make the sentence correct grammatically. 
            They give the sentence its correct form—its structure. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you remove the structure words from a sentence, you will probably still understand the sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you remove the content words from a sentence, you will not understand the sentence. The sentence has no sense or meaning.
